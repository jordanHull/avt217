    <p class="text">Maladi Moun: translating to “human-caused illness,” those afflicted experience psychosis and depression, but many believe this disorder to be caused by the envy, hatred, anger, or other negative emotions directed at one person from another. Some even believe that it can cause academic or social problems. </p>

    <p class="text">The term maladi moun, literally from Haitian Creole meaning “evil or sickness caused or sent by others” or “human-caused illness,” is used in the Haitian community to explain various mental health disorders. Maladi moun is popularly seen as a “spiritual attack” on an individual as a result of envy, hatred, or jealousy by another person, causing the individual to experience symptoms such as psychosis or depression. From a modern psychiatric point of view, it may correspond to disorders such as delusions (persecutory type) or schizophrenia (with paranoid features), or the first phase of psychosis.</p>
