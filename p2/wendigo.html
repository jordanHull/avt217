    <p class="text">Wendigo Psychosis: those afflicted experience an insatiable craving for human flesh even when other food options are apparent and available. The Indian tribe with early experience with this disorder believed that those afflicted were possessed by a dangerous, flesh-devouring spirit called a wendigo. The wendigo (/ˈwɛndɪɡoʊ/)(also wetiko) is a mythological man-eating creature or evil spirit from the folklore of the First Nations Algonquian tribes based in the northern forests of Nova Scotia, the East Coast of Canada, and Great Lakes Region of Canada and the United States. The wendigo is described as a monster with some characteristics of a human or as a spirit who has possessed a human being and made them become monstrous. Its influence is said to invoke acts of murder, insatiable greed, cannibalism and the cultural taboos against such behaviors.</p>

    <p class="text">The creature lends its name to the controversial modern medical term, described by psychiatrists as a culture-bound syndrome with symptoms such as an intense craving for human flesh and fear of becoming a cannibal. In some Indigenous communities, environmental destruction and insatiable greed are also seen as a manifestation of Wendigo psychosis.</p>
