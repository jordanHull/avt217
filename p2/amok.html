    <p class="text">Amok: those afflicted can snap into extreme psychotic fits of rage with the smallest of stimuli, often followed with exhaustion and amnesia. Similar to the concept of the berserker made by the Norse.</p>

    <p class="text">A syndrome first reported in the Malay people, usually male, consisting of a period of brooding followed by a sudden outburst of indiscriminate murderous frenzy, sometimes provoked by an insult, jealousy or sense of desperation. The person who runs amok may also die in a form of murder-suicide. Spelled also amuck. The Malay word for "furious attack." Similar syndromes such as cafard in Polynesia and mal de pelea in Puerto Rico are known to occur in other peoples.</p>
