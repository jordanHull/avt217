    <p class="text">Cold Urticaria: also called cold allergy, those afflicted have almost immediate reactions on the skin when exposed to low temperatures. This can occur with common things like cold air or cold water.</p>

    <p class="text">Cold urticaria is a condition that affects the skin. Signs and symptoms generally include reddish, itchy welts (hives) and/or swelling when skin is exposed to the cold (i.e. cold weather or swimming in cold water). This rash is usually apparent within 2-5 minutes after exposure and can last for 1-2 hours. The exact cause of cold urticaria is poorly understood in most cases. Rarely, it may be associated with an underlying blood condition or infectious disease.</p>
