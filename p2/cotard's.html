    <p class="text">Cotard’s Syndrome: most afflicted believe that they are dead (walking corpses), with rare cases causing people to believe they are immortal. Cotard’s syndrome is a relatively rare condition that was first described by Dr. Jules Cotard in 1882. Cotard’s syndrome comprises any one of a series of delusions that range from a belief that one has lost organs, blood, or body parts to insisting that one has lost one’s soul or is dead.</p>

    <p class="text">Cases have been reported in patients with mood disorders, psychotic disorders, and medical conditions. Most cases of Cotard’s are more responsive to electroconvulsive treatment (ECT) than to pharmacological treatment.
    Previous reports of patients with Cotard’s syndrome have indicated that ECT has tremendous advantages in resolution of patient’s symptoms when pharmacotherapy has failed.</p>
