    <p>I stand here today, grateful for the diversity of my heritage, aware that my parents' dreams live on in my precious daughters. I stand here knowing that my story is part of the larger <a href="page10.html">American</a> story, that I owe a debt to all of those who came before me, and that, in no other country on earth, is my story even possible. </p>
