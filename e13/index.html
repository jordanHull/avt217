    <h1>Exercise 13</h1>
    <h2>My Instructions:</h2>
    <div class="list">
      <ol>
        <li>Open XD.</li>
        <li>Create a custom artboard that is (9*(50*(4*(1/2))) pixels wide, by the total number of Pokemon plus 4.</li>
        <li>Draw a rectangle with these values (if a value is not specified, leave it as the default):
          <ul>
            <li>X: 71</li>
            <li>Y: 70</li>
            <li>W: 42</li>
            <li>H: Whatever time it is as you're making this, but without the colon.</li>
            <li>Fill: Set the last three digits to 390, the first three after the '#' character can be anything you want.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Draw a triangle with these values (if a value is not specified, leave it as the default):
          <ul>
            <li>X: (2.3*100)*2</li>
            <li>Y: 127</li>
            <li>W: The year of the first recorded Christmas.</li>
            <li>H: 44</li>
            <li>Opacity: The corresponding number to the position of the letter 'H' in the English alphabet.</li>
            <li>Border Color: Set the first four digits after the '#' character to 1172, the last two can be anything you want.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Create a text box to these specifications (if a value is not specified, leave it as the default):
          <ul>
            <li>X: 460 pixels away from the right side of the rectangle and 86 pixels away from the right side of the artboard.</li>
            <li>Y: 187 pixels below the triangle.</li>
            <li>W: same as the triangle.</li>
            <li>H: 92</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Within that text box, copy this phrase EXACTLY (without quotations):
          <ul>
            <li>"i'm here to kick ass and take names, and i'm all out of "</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Finish that phrase with anything you want! Try and make it funny, if you can!</li>
        <li>Next, set the artboard fill color to:
          <ul>
            <li>The year America was officially founded, divided by how many Wonders of the World there are plus 1, squared, rounded up, then add any number below 72 to your result.</li>
            <li>Use this for clarification: result = ((America's founding)/(num of wonders of the world + 1))^2, take 'result' to the nearest whole number, then result+N, where N is less than 72.</li>
            <li>Then, take that number (it should be two digits) and place it three times after the '#' character to make a HEX code and set the background to it!</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Finally, export the artboard to wherever you want on your computer, and send the final result back to me through our chosen form of communication.</li>
        <li>Done!</li>
      </ol>
